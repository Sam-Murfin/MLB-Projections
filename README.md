MLB Win projections for the 2016 season using logistic regression and retrosheet data

As the sports betting world expands and crosses over with data science there is a multitude of questions that come along with that expansion. 
How much can the average data scientist learn from historical data and apply it to sports betting?
How do sportsbooks create fair betting lines?
The main question this project aims to answer is even more simple: Can we predict the outcome of an MLB game using only pitching data?


This project is very shallow dive into machine learning and its applications using Python and logistic regressions. The sports betting industry has evolved within the last decade or so where data scientists have started to use their expertise and tools to help the average sports fans and guide them in the right direction, most of the time for a small fee. Those data scientists look to match the models of the sportsbook as accurately as possible to try and get an edge on the bookies- thats obviously how you can make money betting on sports. This project will also analyze its model and show how confidently it predicts wins and losses, which could then coincide with sportsbooks moneylines to try with some additional data that is not included.
